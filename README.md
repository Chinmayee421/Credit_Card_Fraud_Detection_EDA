# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Risk Analytics in Banking** 📊🏦

## **Project Overview** 🎯
This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to real-world banking risk analytics. By analyzing loan application data, the goal is to identify patterns that indicate a client's likelihood of defaulting on a loan. 
This helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions and minimize financial risk.



## **Business Understanding** 💡
Loan providers face challenges when approving loans due to applicants' insufficient or non-existent credit history. Key risks in loan approval include:

- **Loss of Business** 💸: Rejecting applicants who are capable of repaying the loan.
- **Financial Loss** 🚫: Approving loans for applicants likely to default.

By analyzing loan application data, this project aims to identify indicators of loan default, enabling institutions to optimize their approval process.


## **Dataset Information** 📁
The dataset consists of three files:

1. **application_data.csv**: Client information at the time of loan application.
2. **previous_application.csv**: Historical loan application details.
3. **columns_description.csv**: Describes the meaning of various variables.



## **Objectives** 🎯
- **Identify patterns** 🧩 to predict loan default risk.
- **Determine key factors** 🔑 contributing to payment difficulties.
- **Analyze missing data, outliers, and imbalances** ⚖️.
- **Perform univariate and bivariate analysis** 📊 for insights.
- **Identify correlations** 🔗 for defaulting and non-defaulting clients.
- **Visualize findings** 🎨 using appropriate graphs.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** 💡 for financial institutions.
